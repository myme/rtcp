* Network setup (NAT, ICE, STUN)

** ICE

*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment][Interactive Connectivity Establishment (Wikipedia)]]

#+begin_quote
Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a technique used in computer
networking to find ways for two computers to talk to each other as directly as
possible in peer-to-peer networking.
#+end_quote

** STUN - NAT traversal

*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN][STUN (Wikipedia)]]

#+begin_quote
Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a standardized set of methods,
including a network protocol, for traversal of network address translator (NAT)
gateways in applications of real-time voice, video, messaging, and other
interactive communications.

** TURN

*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT][Traversal Using Relays around NAT (Wikipedia)]]

#+begin_quote
Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) is a protocol that assists in traversal
of network address translators (NAT) or firewalls for multimedia applications.
